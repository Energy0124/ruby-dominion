Card Contexts:
- Owned by player (in hand, deck, discard, etc)
- In game, but not by a player (in supply, trash, etc)
- Not in game (while randomizing, picking rules, documentation of cards, etc)

Abstractly, all cards have a context, even that last bit, which is essentially a game in a special phase.
